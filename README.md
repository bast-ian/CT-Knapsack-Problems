# CT-Knapsack-Problems

This code was developed for a project in one of my academic modules, Computational Thinking along with a partner. It involves a dynamic programming algorithm to identify an optimal solution for a single-knapsack problem and a greedy algorithm to provide a suboptimal solution to a multiple-knapsack problem.

Refer to CT_Proj.pptx for details and complexities of the two algorithms.

Datasets for testing purposes are made available in the folder.
